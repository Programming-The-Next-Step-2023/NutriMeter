# NutriMeter
NutriMeter is a Shiny app that helps you track and optimise your nutrient intake.
You can log the foods you eat in a food diary. Based on the entries in your food diary, and your age and gender,
the app calculates how much of target essential nutrients you have consumed for the day. The target amounts are based on the
RDA (Recommended Daily Allowances) published by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine of the United States.
To launch the app:
1) Install the app by running `remotes::install_github("Programming-The-Next-Step-2023/NutriMeter")` in R
2) Library the app by running `library(NutriMeter)`
3) Run `runNutrimeterApp()`. A new window with the app should now open.
